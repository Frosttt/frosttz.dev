Hello, Frost here! Welcome to my first blog on Cohost! For those who don't know I'm a raccoon game dev based in the Seattle, I work as an software engineer at a porting game studio called PlayEveryWare. My job involves porting indie games onto console. During the evening, I am working on some art or whatever catches my interest. Some of my professional experience involves at Epic Games for an internship on a little game you might've heard of called Fortnite and JUST recently I finished co-development on porting [Potionomics](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/) to consoles!  I am still really new into the game industry, I just started my career last year but I want to share my experience with you all and offer my perspective as a junior.

## Update
### Art 
I just hit 2000 followers on twitter so and I thought I'd make this blog post to give a big update on the ongoings of well idk me! I hadn't been posting much of my personal art (I see you those who like and retweet it and I **APPRECIATE** you real ones) and commissions. This is because I was a burnt out after artfight, I pushed myself pretty hard and grew a lot during it but balancing all that with a full time job is difficult. I have been picking up the pencil again so don't worry stuff is coming! Financials are getting strained so I have been slowing down on the commissions though. BUT I do have some cool things coming soon~

## So what have I been doing?
Recently I've met some real cool people and they have given me a lot of time for self reflection and I want to focus more on developing my main skills. I won't stop doing art but I do still love programming and I want to learn more!

### Dev Blog (or vlogs?)
My first step in the plan is to start a blog for game dev.  My original plan was to use Cohost but it seems like it's shutting down at the end of the month (unlucky...) so I'll probably look for an alternative solution for the future haha. (probably going to make my own site and maybe do twitter threads or something?). I am excited for this though because I've been looking for wars to share more of my experience and things I learn.

### Making More Games
In order to pursue and build my skills, I am shifting to making personal game projects. I plan on releasing a bunch of small games and eventually a bigger one on Steam and itch.io. I have a current project I have finished pre-production on that I'm excited to get going. I do not have a planned release date but soon I'll have stuff to share so stay tuned!

### Personal Showcase
Also another small project on a side is a personal web site. I have no web dev experience but I have recently met some cool friends that have been a great resource to me. I do not expect to have something releasing this year but I have been exploring ways to share more of my furry art and organizing it all so you guys can explore my raccoon art and my personal art too.


All in all, this may be the first of many blogs but probably my only one or so on cohost due to the shutdown. I plan on posting more but I'm still working on all the structure for this and it'll take time. Thanks for all the support and love. I hope you guys look forward to my new content.
