        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Frost. I'm a raccoon game dev who lives in the pacific northwest in Seattle. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Game Design from Digipen Institute of Technology.
            I've been programming for over 10 years and I really found my passion within game dev. Whether it's building engines, writing game code, or just writing something for fun. I really love the puzzle and challenge it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always loved playing games growing up and I've achieved my dream of being able to work full time making games. It's really a lot of fun and I enjoy my work a lot. I used this drive to develop my skills beyond programming.
            Such as learning how to draw, design games, and craft experiences. There's just something really entertaining to me about drawing stuff to the screen and watching it come to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm working at PlayEveryWare as a software engineer. My responsibility is porting games onto console platforms. Being Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5. 
            I am also working on independant game projects on the side that are unnannounced and developing my skills further.
        </p>
